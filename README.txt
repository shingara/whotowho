== HISTORY:

WhoToWho made in first for my friend group. For Christmas, we decide to
group us and we offer one present for only one other personne. The price is
define in first for this present.

Before WhoToWho, we made a group before the Christmas night and we made a
random choice of who must offer to who. The choice is made with little paper
in hat.

Now we are in different place and we can't see every week. So, like we have
all an email, I created WhoToWho. So I can't know who must be offer to who and
it's a total random.

Yes, WhoToWho is useless. But What is really usefull?

  - email6

= File of mail configuration

It's the same of actionmailer. But I have add a configuration of from. You need had :from:

:address: Allows you to use a remote mail server. Just change it from its default "localhost" setting.
:port: On the off chance that your mail server doesnâ€˜t run on port 25, you can change it.
:domain: If you need to specify a HELO domain, you can do it here.
:user_name: If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.
:password: If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.
:authentication: If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the authentication type here. This is a symbol and one of :plain, :login, :cram_md5
:from: Define the email who send all mail in from header

= File of mail content

This file is a simple text file. You have two patterns who change before the send.

 * #{who} : it's the name of person who receiv the mail
 * #{towho} : the name of person assign to personne who receiv this mail
